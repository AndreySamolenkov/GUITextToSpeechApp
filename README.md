# GUITextToSpeechApp
Tkinter text to speech app

This is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) 
for a text-to-speech (TTS) converter. The program uses the gTTS library to convert text entered 
by the user into speech, and saves the output as an mp3 file. 
The program also allows the user to select a language for the TTS output. 
The os library is used to play the generated audio file. 
The program creates a GUI window with a label, an entry field, a drop-down menu for selecting the language, 
and a button to initiate the conversion and play the audio.
